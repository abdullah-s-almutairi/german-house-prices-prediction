# german-house-prices-prediction

# Overview
Accurately estimating the value of real estate is an important problem for many stakeholders including house owners, house buyers, agents, and investors. It is also a difficult one. Though it is common knowledge that factors such as the size, number of rooms and location affect the price, there are many other things at play. Additionally, prices are sensitive to changes in market demand and the peculiarities of each situation, such as when a property needs to be urgently sold. The sales price of a property can be predicted in various ways, but is often based on regression techniques. All regression techniques essentially involve one or more predictor variables as input and a single target variable as output.

# The Objectives
The goal is to help us understand the relationship between house features and how these variables are used to predict house price. In addition, house price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices. By using the machine learning we can predict housing prices based on certain features.

# Dataset
We chose to use a dataset from Kaggle platform called "German House Prices".
This dataset has 10552 observations and 25 features.
The features could be useful are: Type, Rooms, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Floors, Garagetype
,Garages, City.

# Algorithms
•	In this problem we will use the Regression Algorithms to make predictions about data.

Tools
I will used the following popular Python libraries in data science 
•	NumPy
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn
